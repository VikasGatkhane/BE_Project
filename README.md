**Problem:**  Some hostel students use prohibited high-power devices like geysers and electric irons, causing circuit overloads. 
          Hostel authorities are unaware of which rooms are responsible. <br>
          <br>
**Solution:** We have developed a smart system that detects excess electricity consumption using IoT.
          When a user exceeds the allowed load, the system displays a sine waveform and sends SMS notifications to both the student and the hostel rector.
          After three warnings, the electricity supply is automatically cut off.
